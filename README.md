autodc
======

`autodc` is a small script used to automatize the transfer of images
from a digital camera into a specified directory.
It is made of two files, one rule file for udev and a script
to be launched when a camera is plugged.

[udev](http://wiki.debian.org/udev)

Configuration is kinda specific to my way of doing.
I use Fabric to deploy the two


Uses udev and gphoto.
