autodc
======

*autodc* is a small script used to automatize the transfer of images
from a digital camera into a specified directory.
It is made of two files, one rule file for
[udev](http://wiki.debian.org/udev) and a script
to be launched when a camera is plugged.

Configuration is kinda specific to my way of doing.
I use:
 * Fabric to deploy the two
 * gphoto
 * bootstrap
